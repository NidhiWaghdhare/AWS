1.WHAT IS CLOUD ?
 ---------------

		In the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the internet instead of your computer's hard drive. 
	Ultimately, the "cloud" is just a metaphor for the internet. It goes back to the days of flowcharts and presentations that would represent the gigantic
	 server-farm infrastructure of the internet as nothing but a puffy cloud, accepting connections and doling out information as it floats.
	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical 
	data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider 
	like Amazon Web Services (AWS).Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software,
	 analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

2.WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLOUDS?
 ----------------------------------------

		There are three main models for cloud computing. Each model represents a different part of the cloud computing stack:
		
		i).Infrastructure as a service(IaaS)
		ii).Platform as a service(PaaS)
		iii).Software as a service(SaaS)

i).Infrastructure as a service(IaaS):
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and
			 typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.
			 Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources
			 and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

ii).Platform as a service(PaaS):
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			
			Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems)
			 and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry 
			about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved 
			in running your application.

iii).Software as a service(SaaS):
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

			Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring
			 to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is 
			maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software.
			 A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to 
			the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.


3.ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD?
 ---------------------


	i]. Agility
	~~~~~~~~~~~:

		The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine.
		 You can quickly spin up resources as you need them–from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things,
		 machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to
		 implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer
		 experiences, and transform your business.


	ii].Elasticity
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:

		With cloud computing, you don’t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, 
		you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly to grow and shrink capacity 
		as your business needs change.
	
	

	iii].Cost savings
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:

		The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you
		 consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale. 



	iv].Deploy globally in minutes
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:

		With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world,
		 so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users 
		reduces latency and improves their experience. 	




4.WHAT IS EC-2 (ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD)?
 ------------------------------------

	Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your
	 need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers
	 as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes 
	in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.		

	*features of EC-2:
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		$.Virtual computing environments, known as instances

		$.Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs),
		 that package the bits you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software)

		$.Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as instance types

		$.Secure login information for your instances using key pairs (AWS stores the public key, and you store the private key in a secure place)

		$.Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when you stop or terminate your instance, known as instance store volumes

		$.Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as Amazon EBS volumes

		$.Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, known as Regions and Availability Zones

		$.A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using security groups

		$.Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses

		$.Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources

		$.Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS cloud, and that you can optionally connect to your own network,
		 known as virtual private clouds (VPCs)




5. WHAT ARE PROS AND CONS OF EC-2?
 ----------------------------------


		*Pros:
		~~~~~~

			$.EC2 has wide variety of machine configurations. If the intended solutions are memory heavy, CPU heavy, GPU heavy or IO heavy, 
				EC2 will provide proper machine configurations as per the requirements.

			$.EC2 has lot of Machine Images to setup OS and required softwares. It also allows you to create the image of your own disk.
			 This facilitates user to stop the EC2 instance without loosing the work. It helps to reduce the bill. The image can be attached again 
			to EC2 to start from the same place from where it was left.

			$.Amazon allows different way to obtain instances like on-demand, spot and reserved. Depending upon the need, one can take wise decision
			 to save cost and address the situation in the best possible way.

		*Cons:
		~~~~~~

			$.This service is a bit difficult to consume. New users need a big learning curve to use this service effectively.

			$.UI for EC2 service is a little complex and at many places, it misses detailed explanation.

			$.Sometimes it takes too long to create images of EC2 instances. This keeps your EC2 up for that extra time. When instances are heavy,
			 it penalizes a lot of money.
